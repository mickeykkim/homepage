# React JS Resume Webpage

![Splash](https://imgur.com/YC9YIZW.png)

This is a React JS resume webpage adapted from Tim Baker's react template (credits below). It is currently a work-in-progress.

All data is populated from a json file (<a href="https://github.com/mickeykkim/homepage/blob/master/public/resumeData.json">public/resumeData.json</a>) that the user can edit.

Gh-pages branch (website files) are deployed through the command `npm run deploy`.

TODO: Remove the progress-bar style skills and replace with something more intuitive i.e. simple labels "Years of experience" or similar.
TODO: Finish contact form functionality.
