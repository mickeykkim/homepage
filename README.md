![Splash](https://imgur.com/YC9YIZW.png)

This is a React JS resume webpage adapted from Tim Baker's react template (credits below) with some changes/updates to layout and css along with gh-pages integration for github hosting.

All data is populated from a json file (<a href="https://github.com/mickeykkim/homepage/blob/master/public/resumeData.json">public/resumeData.json</a>) that the user can edit.

<a href="https://github.com/mickeykkim/homepage/tree/gh-pages">Gh-pages branch</a> (website files) are deployed through the command `npm run deploy`.
